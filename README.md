# Substance-Extraction

Problem Faced: Manual extraction of substance from each and every file which resulted in a lot of manual effort and time consumption

Solution:-

• Solving this problem using artifical intelligence through Custom NER
• Spacy makes this task pretty easy but it is important to know that it uses a deep neural network behind the curtains
• You just have to create the training data and specify the index of the item you want to extract
• I used regex in order to find the index and make the training data


Libraries used:-
 1)Spacy
 2)Regex
